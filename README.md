Generic version of 6 sorting algorithms 

This project covers advanced topics in java. 
I first read through and understood how 6 different sorting algorithms work and then I converted them from mehtods that only take ints into methods that take any type.
Meanwhile I added a counter function to each sorting method to analyze the performance. 
Lastly, I made a conlusion about the speed of each sorting algorithm and their applicaiton depedning on the count of iterations.
