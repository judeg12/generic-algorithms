Selection sort - performs the same iterations reglardless of how much of array is sorted.
Insertion sort - Sorted arrays need significantly less iterations.
Bubble sort - Sorted arrays need significantly less iterations.
Merge sort - Performs the same number of iterations regardless of how much is sorted because it breaks up the array. (My counter has an issue)
Quick sort - Performs less iterations if array is not sorted.
Heap sort - (counter has an issue)


				comparision across althorithms:
Across algorithms, quick sort had the least iterations with merge sort in the same ballpark. 
Selection sort had the most. For an array that is already sorted, 
Insertion Sort and Bubble sort perfom equally as the fastest.
